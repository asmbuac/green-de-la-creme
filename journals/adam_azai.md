Today, I worked on:

* Creating the forum table by making the first migration
* Learning how to merge into main with merge requests and closing issues with the group

Today we had our first standup as a group. I ended up as scrum master for the day and simply explained what we did yesterday and what our goals for today was. I would like to say that we reached the goals we set our group up for. Each of us ended up getting experience in creating a migration and learning how to approve/set up merge requests in GitLab.

Today I found that we can alter our migrated tables to include the foreign keys at a later date so we do not need to stress over potential stretch goal migrations in the future. The alter SQL statement allows us to alter the migration table down the line.
