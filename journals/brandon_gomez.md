3/28/23

- Today I wrote a table for blog migrations, and dived into handling merge requests on Gitlab which was very educational for me

- Conversated with the team about including foreign keys for future stretch goals but ultimately decided to leave them out as we can always insert them in later

- One small ah-ha moment was related to getting Beekeeper up and running to test the code

3/29/23

- Today I completed a PUT endpoint for the team and got more some more practice with getting familiar with relations between queries and routers

- Discussed with the team about out goals for the day and what we wanted to get done. Ultimately decided to pursue hitting the endpoints for today and tomorrow and move onto the auth portion soon

- One ah-ha moment for me was when I was live coding with my teammate Shayne and I took note on how she refactored her code to give it a better sense of readability which I thought was very impressive
