## 3/28/23
- Today I wrote a table for blog migrations, and dived into handling merge requests on Gitlab which was very educational for me
- Conversated with the team about including foreign keys for future stretch goals but ultimately decided to leave them out as we can always insert them in later
- One small ah-ha moment was related to getting Beekeeper up and running to test the code

## 3/29/23
- Today I completed a PUT endpoint for the team and got more some more practice with getting familiar with relations between queries and routers
- Discussed with the team about out goals for the day and what we wanted to get done. Ultimately decided to pursue hitting the endpoints for today and tomorrow and move onto the auth portion soon
- One ah-ha moment for me was when I was live coding with my teammate Shayne and I took note on how she refactored her code to give it a better sense of readability which I thought was very impressive

## 3/30/23
- Today I worked on the GET and DELETE endpoint. Also as a team we started on the backend authentication and make large strides in terms of progress
- More conversations on where we want to be in the future, not much talk today but rather lots of work
- A big ah-ha moment for me was just learning how to complete backend auth with fastAPI since I’ve never attempted to create it before

## 4/3/23
- Today the team finished the last one the backend authentication while me and my teammate Adam worked on creating issues and merge requests and installing packages and dependencies for our project
- Today the team discussed on implementing Tailwind to structure our css and we ultimately decided on using the react redux toolkit to help us manage state
- One ah-ha moment for me was learning how to install and implement React Redux

## 4/4/23
- Today I pair programmed with Regan working on the front end Sign up screen. After a couple hours of that we joined back with the rest of the team to try and figure out how to get our front end authetication to work.
- Small conversations about how we want the front end to look like and what to include in our forms
- One ah-ha moment for me was working with Tailwind and figuring out how to use it and how to debug if something isn’t showing on the front end.

## 4/6/23
- Today I worked with Shayne, Shayne being the driver and I the navigator. We were able to get the blog list view up and running and had James join us in the room to help with protecting endpoint in the frontend.
- Not much conversations today as the team was more focused on working on our components.
- One ah-ha moment was having James help us with auth and realizing our issue was much simpler than we originally thought

## 4/17/23
- Today I worked on the create feature for blogs on the frontend. Had to deal with using RTK and learned a lot from looking at documentation
- Conversations with the team about structure and how we want our website to look
- One ah-ha moment that I had was involved with using mutations from redux

## 4/18/23
- Implemented a functioning navbar since all we had prior was a small logout button. Logout is functional along with routes to threads and back to the blog page. Left icons for future stretch goals.
- Conversations about what to include in README along with talks about getting the unit tests done in the near future.
- One ah-ha moment I had was getting the spacing right on the navbar and getting the avatar to be placed in the correct position

## 4/19/23
- Fully completed all the mvp CRUD! Merged the navbar with main and got started working on the delete function on blogs for the frontend.
- Got started on working with deployment, Regan got us started off but setting it up with part one.
- One ah-ha moment I had was around the delete, just more general practice using redux mutations which is always great

## 4/20/23
- Took a deep dive into the delete buttons for blogs, got it styled and felt satisfied with the end result
- Shayne and Regan were fixing deployment issues we were running into, but mainly everyone was working on their own things for the majority of the day
- One ah-ha moment I had was learning more about tailwind and its features and testing its capabilities.

## 4/24/23
- Got started on the landing page and got a template sorted out. Wanted to work with the sticky function and played around with different styles and layouts. Not sure if i’m quite done yet as I still want to implement new features to make the site look better
- Team conversated on where we are with our project and when we are going to feel comfortable presenting. Came to a consensus that we should knock our presentation and then take a deep dive into our stretch goals
- An ah-ha moment I had today was frontend related and seeing how flex and grids work on a more deeper level and understanding how things on the webpage will turn out

## 4/25/23
- Continued to work on the landing page. Overall feeling complete with it but still wanting to add some sort of new features just not quite sure. Styling needs more work.
- Conversations mainly around styling for our website. Core features and functions are pretty much complete besides future stretch goals so the team is just ironing out the small details
- No ah-ha moment today just more practice in working in the front-end

## 4/26/23
- Last day of working on the landing page. Tried to configure a sort of function surrounding cards but decided to scrap it last second considering they would sometimes not work. Finishing up on styling. Included a lottie animation upon loading the landing page and worked some more on including a team page at the very bottom with links to the teams gitlab and individual linked in’s
- Decided we want to present early so we can get started on our stretch goals as soon as we can without fear of breaking the site and not being able to present for our mvp
- No ah-ha moment today either considering the cards were giving me a hard time, perhaps tomorrow.

## 4/27/23
- Today the team was planning on getting reviewed for our mvp so I just worked on any finishing touches I could and wrote in some missing journal entries.
- Successfully did our presentation for Rosheen and everything went smoothly! The team got praise on the work and felt satisfied with how everything turned out
- No ah ha moment today but definitely a relief moment after everything was finished weeks of work got put into this project and I know I’m very proud of how the website came out
