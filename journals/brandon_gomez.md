3/28/23

- Today I wrote a table for blog migrations, and dived into handling merge requests on Gitlab which was very educational for me

- Conversated with the team about including foreign keys for future stretch goals but ultimately decided to leave them out as we can always insert them in later

- One small ah-ha moment was related to getting Beekeeper up and running to test the code

3/29/23

- Today I completed a PUT endpoint for the team and got more some more practice with getting familiar with relations between queries and routers

- Discussed with the team about out goals for the day and what we wanted to get done. Ultimately decided to pursue hitting the endpoints for today and tomorrow and move onto the auth portion soon

- One ah-ha moment for me was when I was live coding with my teammate Shayne and I took note on how she refactored her code to give it a better sense of readability which I thought was very impressive

3/30/23

- Today I worked on the GET and DELETE endpoint. Also as a team we started on the backend authentication and make large strides in terms of progress

- More conversations on where we want to be in the future, not much talk today but rather lots of work

- A big ah-ha moment for me was just learning how to complete backend auth with fastAPI since I've never attempted to create it before

4/3/23

- Today the team finished the last one the backend authentication while me and my teammate Adam worked on creating issues and merge requests and installing packages and dependencies for our project

- Today the team discussed on implementing Tailwind to structure our css and we ultimately decided on using the react redux toolkit to help us manage state

- One ah-ha moment for me was learning how to install and implement React Redux

4/4/23

- Today I pair programmed with Regan working on the front end Sign up screen. After a couple hours of that we joined back with the rest of the team to try and figure out how to get our front end authetication to work.

- Small conversations about how we want the front end to look like and what to include in our forms

- One ah-ha moment for me was working with Tailwind and figuring out how to use it and how to debug if something isn't showing on the front end.
